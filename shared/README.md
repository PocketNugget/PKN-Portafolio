# Shared Directory

This directory is intended for shared configuration, types, or utility code that may be used by both the frontend (React) and backend (Deno) services.

- Place TypeScript types, API schemas, or constants here if you want to keep them in sync between client and server.
- You can import files from this directory in both the frontend and backend as needed.
